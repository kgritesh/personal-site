At Pashi, I spearheaded critical contributions that facilitated the deployment of our platform at a leading two-wheeler manufacturer. Our solution empowered floor operators to visualize and design assembly lines, including intricate logic, using a No-Code UI, which was then transformed into efficient Golang source code.

**Key Contributions**:

- **Reliability**: Ensured top-notch system stability vital for uninterrupted manufacturing, recognizing that any hiccup could lead to significant setbacks.
- **Simulation Engine**: Pioneered an engine simulating the entire assembly line, including hardware and sensors, enabling predictive insights and preemptive troubleshooting.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Devised a universal layer accommodating a diverse range of devices and sensors, streamlining integration.
- **Code Generation**: Innovated a context-aware wrapper around the Golang AST, simplifying the integration of new features into our No-Code UI.
- **Custom Code Integration**: Designed a hybrid system, marrying the ease of No-Code UI with the flexibility of custom coding.
- **Process Abstraction**: Delved deep into manufacturing terminologies and procedures, constructing comprehensible and versatile abstractions for seamless platform implementation.
- **Frontend Revamp**: Transitioned the frontend to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with progressive enhancement, enhancing user experience and ensuring minimal frontend alterations if backend code generation mechanisms changed.
- **Performance**: Maintained optimal system response times and efficiency, ensuring a smooth user experience and rapid data processing.
