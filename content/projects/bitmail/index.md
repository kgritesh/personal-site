A decentralized application built on top of Ethereum using solidity to reduce email spam. The project allowed users to put a paywall in front of their inbox. The sender of an email can bid on several Ethereum tokens he is willing to give for the receiver to read his/her email. The money was held in a smart contract and only if the receiver reads the email, money would be transferred to his/her account otherwise after predetermined days, money would be sent back to the senderâ€™s account.
